# Solving a Regression Problem with Various Models

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of solving a regression problem using multiple machine learning models. The notebook walks through data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, showcasing different regression techniques on an environmental indicators dataset.

## Contents

- **Dataset and Libraries**: Introduction to the dataset and necessary Python libraries.
- **Data Exploration**: Preliminary exploration to understand the structure and relationships within the data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to prepare the data for modeling, including feature scaling and train-test split.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implementation and comparison of various regression models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook contains environmental indicators for different countries, including features such as forest coverage, biodiversity index, and deforestation rate.

- **Source**: [Environmental Indicators Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Explore-AI/Public-Data/master/Data/regression_sprint/enviro_indicators.csv)
- **Features**:
  - `forest_coverage`
  - `biodiversity_index`
  - `protected_areas`
  - `deforestation_rate`
  - `carbon_sequestration`
  - `soil_erosion`
  - `land_degradation`
  - `rural_population`
  - `population_density`
  
## Data Exploration

- Displaying the dataset information and statistics.
- Visualizing relationships between features using pair plots and a correlation heatmap.
- Identifying the most relevant features for predicting the target variable (`deforestation_rate`).

## Data Preprocessing

- Separating features and the target variable.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Applying MinMaxScaler for feature scaling.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Simple Linear Regression

- Training a simple linear regression model using `biodiversity_index` as the predictor.
- Evaluating the model performance using R² and MSE metrics.

### Multiple Linear Regression

- Training a multiple linear regression model with all features.
- Evaluating the model performance.

### Decision Tree Regression

- Training a decision tree regression model.
- Evaluating the model performance and tuning hyperparameters.

### Ensemble Models

#### Random Forest Regression

- Training a random forest regression model.
- Evaluating the model performance.

#### Stacking Regression

- Training a stacking ensemble model using linear regression and random forest as base models.
- Evaluating the stacking model performance.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed comparisons of the performance of each model, including visualizations of actual vs. predicted values and evaluation metrics. non the less
In our journey to solve a regression problem we have explored different modelling options, each offering different strengths that could be used to solve the problem at hand. In the end, our goal is to achieve a good balance between performance and simplicity – and remember – more advanced models may not always be the best, despite convincing metrics!
